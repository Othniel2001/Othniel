    <h3>Investing in a currency</h3>
        <p>Investing in foreign currency can be a great way to diversify your portfolio. Foreign currency trading, or forex for short, is a little more complex than trading stocks or mutual funds, or shoring up your investment strategy with bonds. Learning the basics, however, can give you a solid foundation to build on if this is an asset class you’re interested in exploring. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to get started with investing in currency. If you have questions about forex or other types of investments, a financial advisor can help.</p>
    <h3>The forex market</h3>
        <p>The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. This international market's most unique aspect is that it lacks a central marketplace. Instead, currency trading is conducted electronically over the counter (OTC). This means that all transactions occur via computer networks among traders worldwide rather than on one centralized exchange. The market is open 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week. Currencies are traded worldwide in the major financial centers of Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, New York, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, and Zurich—across almost every time zone. This means the forex market begins in Tokyo and Hong Kong when the U.S. trading day ends. As such, the forex market can be highly active at any time, with price quotes changing constantly.</p>
    <h3>The index futures market</h3>
        <p>Index futures are legally binding futures contracts that allow traders to trade derivatives at a predetermined price on a future date. The instruments exchanged under these contracts may include stocks, commodities, or currencies and must be settled in cash on expiry. Among various reasons to use these futures contracts is speculating on the future price direction of an underlying asset or index to make profits. Similarly, it enables investors to hedge their stock portfolio or equity positions against potential losses. Besides, these can be used for volatility trading, spread trading, and determining market sentiment. A futures broker can help with these activities on any stock exchange.</p>
